## Project Charity (React)

This project is a single-page React application I made in January 2020. It's an exemplary website for a nonprofit
organization. Users who visit the page can easily donate their unneeded things (like clothes, books, toys) to other 
people in need: the homeless, the disabled, the poor etc.

I used `create-react-app` tool to set up this project.
